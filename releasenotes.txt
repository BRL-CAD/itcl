This is the second beta release of itcl [incr Tcl]. Ths version is named 
itcl 4.0b2.

There are a lot of new features in that version: delegation additional
to inheritance, where the ideas are mostly "stolen" from snit written by Will
Duquette.

For details look here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/19873

The new class types are:
  - ::itcl::type
  - ::itcl::widget
  - ::itcl::widgetadaptor

As documentation you can additionally use most of:
http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/doc/snit.html, as it was tried to keep the 
script level API motsly identical to snit.

There is also an experimental class type
 - ::itcl::extended class
available, which will be used to build itk like megawidgets (a la iwidgets)
in the future without the need to use itk.
WARNING the interfaces are not yet described in detail, as there may be
changes, so the use of ::itcl::extended class is at the moment
"on your own risk", as the interfaces may still change.
At the moment mostly all of the interfaces of ::itcl::type are supported and
some additional ones where the API has not yet settled, so they are not
described.

The additional class types need no Tk at load timei of itcl, Tk is loaded
automaticly for ::itcl::widget and ::itcl::widgetadaptor if needed. To use
these features you need also the package "itclwidget" installed, to be
found here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/19873

There is one difference to itcl 3.4, the ::itcl::scope command does no longer
return strings like "@......." but a different syntax, but this interface was
always described as internal and not to be used at user level.
