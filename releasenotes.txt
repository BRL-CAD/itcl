This is the second beta release of itcl [incr Tcl]. Ths version is named 
itcl 4.0b2.

To use the package add a line
    package require itcl
or
    package require itcl 4.0
at the top of your script file. Attention this version uses all lower case
for the package name . There is an additional entry for "package require Itcl"
in there for compatibility, but that will probably disapear in the future

There are a lot of new features in that version: especialy delegation additional
to inheritance and components, where the ideas are mostly "stolen" from snit
written by Will Duquette.

For details look here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/19873

The new class types are:
  - ::itcl::type
  - ::itcl::widget
  - ::itcl::widgetadaptor

As documentation you can additionally use most of:
http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/doc/snit.html, as it was tried to keep the 
script level API motsly identical to snit.

There is also an experimental class type
 - ::itcl::extended class
available, which will be used to build itk like megawidgets (a la iwidgets)
in the future without the need to use itk.
WARNING the interfaces are not yet described in detail, as there may be
changes, so the use of ::itcl::extended class is at the moment
"on your own risk", as the interfaces may still change.
At the moment mostly all of the interfaces of ::itcl::type are supported and
some additional ones where the API has not yet settled, so they are not
described.

The additional class types need no Tk at load timei of itcl, Tk is loaded
automaticly for ::itcl::widget and ::itcl::widgetadaptor if needed. To use
these features you need also the package "itclwidget" installed, to be
found here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/19873

There is one difference to itcl 3.4, the ::itcl::scope command does no longer
return strings like "@......." but a different syntax, but this interface was
always described as internal and not to be used at user level.
