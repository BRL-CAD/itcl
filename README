README: itcl ([incr Tcl])

RCS: @(#) $Id: README,v 1.1.2.4 2009/01/09 13:45:27 wiede Exp $

This is the 4.0b2 source distribution of itcl, an object oriented
extension for Tcl. Itcl is available from Sourceforge at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13244&package_id=295641


1. Introduction

This directory contains the source code, documentation, and test scripts
for the itcl extension. This version is a mostly rewritten version
derived from itcl 3.4. The rewriting had several reasons which can
be found here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/19873

In short: it is now based on TclOO and it was tried to make it less dependent
on interial features of Tcl core.

This version claims to be script level compatible with Itcl 3.4.

Itcl is a freely-available open source package as in the past. 
You can do virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it,
redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the file
"license.terms" for complete information.

2. Compiling and Installing.

[incr Tcl] is built in much the same way that Tcl itself is. Once you have
a Tcl build environment set up, you should be able to simply
enter the commands:

    cd itcl
    ./configure
    make all
    make test
    make install

to use the package add a line
    package require itcl
or
    package require itcl 4.0
at the top of your script file. Attention this version uses all lower case
for the package name . There is an additional entry for "package require Itcl"
in there for compatibility, but that will probably disapear in the future

3. Mailing lists

SourceForge hosts a mailing list, incrtcl-users to discuss issues with using
and developing [incr Tcl]. For more information and to subscribe, visit

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/incrtcl

and go to the 'Mailing Lists' page.

4. Support

We are very interested in receiving bug reports, patches, and suggestions
for improvements.  We prefer that you send this information to us via the
bug database, rather than emailing us directly.  The bug database is at:

	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13244

We will log and follow-up on each bug, although we cannot promise a
specific turn-around time.  Enhancements, reported via the Feature
Requests form at the same web site, may take longer and may not happen
at all unless there is widespread support for them.
