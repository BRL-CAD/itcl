1. Introduction

This directory contains the source code, documentation, and test scripts
for the [incr Tcl] extension. This version is a mostly rewritten version
derived from [incr Tcl] 3.4. The rewriting had several reasons which can
be found here: http://wiki.tcl.tk/19873

In short: it is now based on TclOO and it was tried to make it less dependent
on interial features of Tcl core.

This version claims to be script level compatible with Itcl 3.4.

There are a lot of new features in that version: delegation additional
to inheritance, where the ideas are mostly "stolen" from snit written by Will
Duquette. The class types are: ::itcl::type, ::itcl::widget and
::itcl::widgetadaptor.

There is also an experimental class type ::itcl::extended class available,
which will be used to build itk like megawidgets (a la iwidgets) without
the need to use itk.

The additional class types need no Tk at load time, Tk is loaded automatically
for ::itcl::widget and ::itcl::widgetadaptor if needed. To use these features
you need also the package itclwidget installed, to be also found on the 
above link.

[incr Tcl] is a freely-available open source package as in the past. 
You can do virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it,
redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the file
"license.terms" for complete information.

2. Documentation

The 'doc' subdirectory in this release contains a set of reference manual
entries for [incr Tcl].  Files with an extension '.n' are for Tcl classes and
commands; files with an extension '.3' are for C library functions.

3. Compiling and Installing.

[incr Tcl] is built in much the same way that Tcl itself is. Once you have
a Tcl build environment set up, you should be able to simply
enter the commands:

    cd itcl
    ./configure
    make all
    make test
    make install

4. Tcl newsgroup.

There is a USENET news group, "comp.lang.tcl", intended for the exchange of
information about Tcl, Tk, and related applications.  The newsgroup is a
great place to ask general information questions.  For bug reports, please
see the "Support and bug fixes" section below.

5. Tcl'ers Wiki

A Wiki-based open community site covering all aspects of Tcl/Tk is at:

	http://wiki.tcl.tk/

It is dedicated to the Tcl programming language and its extensions.  A
wealth of useful information can be found there.  It contains code
snippets, references to papers, books, and FAQs, as well as pointers to
development tools, extensions, and applications.  You can also recommend
additional URLs by editing the wiki yourself.

6. Mailing lists

SourceForge hosts a mailing list, incrtcl-users to discuss issues with using
and developing [incr Tcl]. For more information and to subscribe, visit

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/incrtcl

and go to the 'Mailing Lists' page.

7. Support

We are very interested in receiving bug reports, patches, and suggestions
for improvements.  We prefer that you send this information to us via the
bug database, rather than emailing us directly.  The bug database is at:

	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13244

We will log and follow-up on each bug, although we cannot promise a
specific turn-around time.  Enhancements, reported via the Feature
Requests form at the same web site, may take longer and may not happen
at all unless there is widespread support for them.

The Tcl community is too large for us to provide much individual support
for users.  If you need help we suggest that you post questions to
comp.lang.tcl.  We read the newsgroup and will attempt to answer esoteric
questions for which no one else is likely to know the answer.
